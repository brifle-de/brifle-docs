## Introduction

This documentation is intended for developers who want to interact directly with the Brifle system.

Brifle follows national German laws. In case of international deliveries you are responsible for compliance with the law.

## Terminology

### Account

An account is associated with a legal person or company. There are two main types of account: personal and business.

### User

A user is required to authorise and log into the system. Each user has at least one account. Corporate accounts can have multiple users.

### Tenant

A tenant is defined as a sender. Each personal account is associated with one private tenant, while each business account is associated with at least one public tenant. It is possible for an account to be associated with multiple tenants, which is useful for companies that have different departments, each of which may send different types of documents, such as HR and Sales.

## Authorization API

In order to operate with the system you need to authorize with the system. For authentication we use oauth2. The account owner needs to setup an api key and generate an api secret. As ventor you can add the x-vendor header to mark that the process was initiated by you.

# Introduction

This documentation is for developers who want to interact with the Brifle System directly.

Brifle is following national German laws. In case of international deliveries you are responsible for fullfilling the law.

# Terminology

#### Account

An account is associated with a legal person or company. There are two main account types: private and business.

#### User

A user is required to authorise and log in to the system. Each user is assigned at least one account. Business accounts can have multiple users.

#### Tenant

A tenant is defined as a sender. Each personal account is associated with a private tenant, while each business account is linked to at least one public tenant. It is possible for an account to be associated with multiple tenants, which is advantageous for companies that have distinct sections, each of which may send documents of a different type, such as the HR and Sales departments.

# Authorization API

In order to operate with the system you need to authorize with the system. For authentication we use oauth2. The account owner needs to setup an api key and generate an api secret. As ventor you can add the x-vendor header to mark that the process was initiated by you.

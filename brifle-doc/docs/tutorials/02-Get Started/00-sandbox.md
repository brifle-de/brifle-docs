# Sandbox
If your objective is to test the API and its capabilities, we advise you to request a sandbox account. This account allows you to test the features you wish to connect to your tools without sending them to a real person. The sandbox is free of charge.

## Setting up a Sandbox Account
The most efficient method for obtaining access to a Sandbox account is to contact us via email. (kontakt@brifle.de). Please provide a brief explanation as to why you require a sandbox account and a valid email address, which can be used to assign the sandbox account to. If you also require a business account, please include this information in the email.

# How to request a Signature

## 1. Create a Signature Reference

A Signature Reference combines multiple signatures into one group. The Reference Identifier is sent with the documents to the users. All users can see all signatures in a Signature Reference group. 

## 2. Collect the receivers and Prepare document

It is essential to collect all the necessary data from the recipient, including their name and other identifying information, in order to facilitate the delivery process. Once this has been completed, the documents can be sent. The signature reference should then be added to the send requests, after which the documents can be sent to the users.

## 3. The Receiver gets notified

The receiver is informed that a new signature is required.
